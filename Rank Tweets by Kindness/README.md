## Project Description 👩‍🏫
Identify positive tweets by counting the occurrence of nice words and ranking them in descending order. 

## Tasks
The project goal will be achieved by going through the following steps:

1. Read the `nice_words.txt` file and store the words associated with kindness in a list. These words could include terms like "love," "compassion," and "gratitude."
2. Read the `tweets.txt` file and store the tweets in a list for further processing.
3. Analyze each tweet and count the occurrence of nice words.
4. Sort the tweets in descending order based on the count of nice words, with the kindest tweet ranked first.
5. Display the ranked tweets along with the count of nice words in each tweet.
sample tweets:
[
    "great and awesome",
    "what a good day"
]
sample output:
[
    ("great and awesome", 2),
    ("what a good day", 1),
]
